# Drupal 7 Module Development [Video]
This is the code repository for [Drupal 7 Module Development [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/drupal-7-module-development-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782161189), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Drupal is an award-winning open-source Content Management System. It's a modular system, with an elegant hook-based architecture, and great code. Modules are plugins for Drupal that extend, build or enhance Drupal core functionality. With this course you will learn to build a Drupal custom module by completing short tasks and ultimately weave the tasks together to get a completed and fully functional module. Drupal 7 Module Development introduces you to module development by understanding the essential hooks and functions, building tables and querying the Drupal database, exploring module security, performance and how our module interacts with Drupal core and contributed modules. Each video walks you through essential Drupal functions and demonstrates how to use these functions in a module that we build hands-on together Drupal 7 Module Development starts by showing you how to set up your local development environment to support custom module development. You will learn how to use the best tools and configure them. Next you will learn to configure a Feeds importer to import content into your site that you will then leverage with your custom module and write a menu callback using hook_menu and hook_permissions. We will then look at the form API and write a hook_form_alter function and create a .install file and build a db schema function to create a table in our database Finally we create a block using our module and theme the block. We end the course by reviewing our module from a security and performance standpoint. From the local development to the review of security we build a custom module step-by-step throughout the courseâ€™s short videos.

CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design covers various aspects of level design while informing the budding designer of ways to achieve their goals with less effort. Even with no prior knowledge of game design, CryENGINE 3 SDK Level Design will show you everything you need to know about game level design, starting from how to load the CryENGINE 3 SDK on to your PC all the way to packing up your first level to play.

In order to make your game level look presentable, the course starts off by helping you get a grasp on the basics, such as creating your first level, working with models, terrain creation, and material editing. However, your journey doesn't stop there, as you will then gain further knowledge of more advanced features such as creating flowgraphs and particles, adding sound, and debugging your level.

By the end of this course, you will be armed with the skills you need to start creating game levels and scenes. While watching these videos, you will learn game creation tactics that not only work for the CryENGINE, but also for most modern day game engines.

Code bundle of this course comes along with the game created in the video course with the CryENGINE Free SDK Version 3.4.5
